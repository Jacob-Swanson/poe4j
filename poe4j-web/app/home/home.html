<h1>What is poe4j?</h1>
<p>
    poe4j is a <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/">Path of Exile</a> datamining library written in Java (hence the 4j
    part of the name).
</p>
<p>
    poe4j is under development. Currently you can use poe4j to extract Content.ggpk and the data from data files. There
    is a GUI included for this.

    Loading data files works similarly to how JPA works. If you've used any frameworks like Hibernate, it should look
    familiar.
</p>
<p>
    The first, and only tool at the moment written with poe4j is a <a ui-sref="chromatic-calculator">Chromatic
    Calculator</a> that has all of the base items and their attribute requirements loaded.

    A random base item is chosen upon loading the page.
